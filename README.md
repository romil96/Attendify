# Attendify

This is a project created as a part of our degree at Jagran Lakecity University, Bhopal.

This project aims to serve multiple purposes. They are as follows: 
  - Learn and recognize the faces of people.
  - To mark their attendance for the day either for a class or for the workplace.
  - Create a CSV and excel file with a timestamp and the name of the person identified in the camera input.

The program also understands the difference between a 2 dimensional image 
and a 3 dimensional face and does not mark attendance if shown a photo of an already learned face.
